There is a lot to this program so your best bet is to watch this video :)

When you first download LiveStreamer Pro you may or may not already have LiveStreamer installed. No biggie, if you do skip this part, if you don't read on!

After extracting LiveStreamer Pro navigate to the folder labeled "LiveStreamer Installer" this will hold the installer needed to run LiveStreamer plugins.

Once you have that installed you are ready to watch streams!

(Please note, I would advise you to download VLC Media Player as it is one of the most effecient media players currently and works well with LiveStreamer)
